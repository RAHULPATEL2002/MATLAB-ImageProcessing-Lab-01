## Project Description

This project is divided into three tasks:
1. **Task 1**: Perform operations on an RGB color image to convert it to grayscale, indexed, and binary images.
2. **Task 2**: Generate black, white, and black-in-white/white-in-black images from a sample image.
3. **Task 3**: Plot a 2D function of the form `f(x, y) = a * sin(u(x) * x + v(y) * y)`.

The code demonstrates basic image processing techniques and 2D plotting in MATLAB.

## Task 1: RGB Image Conversion

- **Original Image**  
  This is the original color image (`peppers.png`) used in the image processing operations.

- **Gray Image (Built-in Function)**  
  The color image was converted to grayscale using the `rgb2gray` MATLAB function.

- **Gray Image (Average Method)**  
  Grayscale conversion using the average of the R, G, and B channel values.

- **Gray Image (Weighted Method)**  
  Grayscale conversion using the weighted sum of R, G, and B channels (0.3, 0.59, 0.11 respectively).

- **RGB to Indexed Image**  
  The RGB image was converted to an indexed image with 16 colors.

- **Binary Image (Built-in Function)**  
  Conversion of the grayscale image to a binary image using MATLABâ€™s `im2bw` function.

## Task 2: Image Manipulations

- **Black Image**  
  A black image generated using zeros in MATLAB.

- **Black-in-White Image**  
  An image where black pixels are set within a white background.

- **White-in-Black Image**  
  An image where white pixels are set within a black background.

## Task 3: 2D Function Plotting

This task involved plotting a 2D function of the form `f(x, y) = a * sin(u(x) * x + v(y) * y)`.

- **2D Function Plot**  
  A random 2D sine wave was plotted based on the equation mentioned above.
